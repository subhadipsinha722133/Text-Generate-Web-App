Powered by Hugging Face: Access a wide range of powerful text generation models available on the Hugging Face Hub.

LangChain Integration: Utilizes LangChain for efficient interaction with the language models.

Secure API Key Handling: Uses environment variables to securely manage your Hugging Face API token.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Python: The core programming language.

Streamlit: For building the interactive web application.

LangChain Hugging Face: The library to connect with and use Hugging Face models.

Hugging Face Hub: Provides the pre-trained language models.

python-dotenv: To manage environment variables.

git clone <your-repository-url>
cd text-generate-web-app

3. Install Dependencies
Install the required Python packages using the requirements.txt file. It's recommended to do this in a virtual environment.

# Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install the packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

Your requirements.txt file should contain:

streamlit
langchain-huggingface
python-dotenv

4. Set Up Environment Variables
You need a Hugging Face API token to use the models.

Get your token from the Hugging Face website.

Create a file named .env in the root directory of your project.

Add your Hugging Face API token to the .env file like this:

HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN="your_hf_api_token_here"

‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Application
Once you have completed the setup, you can run the Streamlit app with the following command in your terminal:

streamlit run app.py

This will start the web server and open the application in your default web browser.
